## How do I get around the Docs?

Each category of commands has their own page which can be found in the navigation bar, You can also search for spicific commands using the search function built into the Docs.

### Understanding how Celendi's commands work

You may be asking yourself how our commands work, and why our example commands in our various categories have &lt; & &gt; and [ & ] in them, those are what we like to call arguments, and this is how they work.  

**Optional**: \[foo\] means that this argument can be ignored \(this is usually for clearing settings or for using yourself/the current channel\).  
**Required**: &lt;foo&gt; means that you _must_ use this argument for the command to work.  
**Many**: &lt;foos...&gt; or \[foos...\] means that you can specify more than one. The reason argument in the ban command is an example of an argument that uses this.  
**Options**: \[foo\|bar\] or &lt;foo\|bar&gt; means that you have different possibilities and you need to choose what one you will use based on what you want to do  
**Mentions:** When there is a &#64; or # before the argument it means that you need to specify the argument as a **mention**. `@` means that you need to specify a **user mention** and `#` as a **channel mention**.

Additionally, the bot uses what are called _converters_ which makes specifying roles, members, channels etc easy and fool-proof. When asked to specify a member, you can provide it as mention \(pinging the person\) or as ID. This principle works for every single command where applicable.
